Even if all the objects cannot be monitored, cryptographic keys and PIN objects shall be considered with particular attention by ST authors as they play a key role in the overall security. • It is also recommended to monitor integrity errors in the code of the native applica- tions and Java Card applets. • For integrity sensitive application, their data shall be monitored (D.APP_I_DATA): applications may need to protect information against unexpected modifications, and explicitly control whether a piece of information has been changed between two accesses. For example, maintaining the integrity of an electronic purse’s balance is extremely important because this value represents real money. Its modification must be controlled, for illegal ones would denote an important failure of the payment system. Evaluation Version ©NXP B.V. 2018. All rights reserved.

It does not address card management issues in the broad sense, but only those security aspects of the installation procedure that are related to applet execution. Applet deletion (ADELG) The ADELG contains the security requirements for erasing in- stalled applets from the card, a feature introduced in Java Card specification version 2.2. Remote Method Invocation The RMIG contains the security requirements for the remote (RMIG) method invocation feature, which provides a new protocol of com- munication between the terminal and the applets. This was intro- duced in Java Card specification version 2.2. Object deletion (ODELG) The ODELG contains the security requirements for the object deletion capability. This provides a safe memory recovering mechanism. This is a Java Card specification version 2.2 fea- ture. Secure carrier (CarG) The CarG group contains minimal requirements for secure down- loading of applications on the card. This group contains the se- curity requirements for preventing, in those configurations that do not support on-card static or dynamic bytecode verification, the installation of a package that has not been bytecode verified, or that has been modified after bytecode verification. External Memory (EMG) The EMG group contains security requirements for the manage- ment of external memory. Tab. 7.1: Requirement Groups Evaluation Version ©NXP B.V. 2018. All rights reserved.

    ". The secure channel allows access to Applications only if the secret keys are known. Further protection implemented in JCOP4 prevents brute force attacks to the secret keys of the Secure Channel.The following mechanisms ensure that it is not possible to access information from the Java Layer without being authorized to do so. • Status informations like Life Cycle of Applets or the Authentication State of a Secure Channel are stored in complex patterned values which protects them from manipulation. • Correct order of Java Card Byte Code execution is ensured by the Virtual Machine which detects if Byte Code of a wrong context is executed. • Correct processing of Byte Codes is ensured by checking at the beginning and end of Byte Code execution that the same Byte Code is executed.Execution of native code in JCOP4 is protected by following mechanisms: • Critical execution paths of the TOE functionality are protected by program flow and call tree protection. This ensures that it is not possible to bypass security relevant checks and verifications. • Critical conditions are evaluated twice. This ensures that physical attacks on the compared values are detected during security relevant checks and verifications. • The true case in if-conditions leads to the less critical program flow or to an error case. This prevents attacks on the program flow during security relevant checks and verifications. • At the exit of critical loops it is checked that the whole loop was processed. This prevents from manipulation of the program flow and jumping out of the loop. • Critical parameters are check for consistency. This prevents from attacks with manipulated parameters.Further protection is achieved by using different buffers for APDUs in case more than one physical interface is supported. This prevents bypassing the state machine on one physical interface by the other interface. Evaluation Version ©NXP B.V. 2018. All rights reserved.

For in- stance, Additional Code could: correct flaws, add new functionalities, update the operating system. Also referred to as D.UPDATE_IMAGE.APDU buffer The APDU buffer is the buffer where the messages sent (received) by the card depart from (ar- rive to). The JCRE owns an APDU object (which is a JCRE Entry Point and an instance of the javac- ard.framework.APDU class) that encapsulates APDU messages in an internal byte array, called the APDU buffer. This object is made accessible to the currently selected applet when needed, but any permanent access (out-of selection-scope) is strictly prohibited for security reasons.applet deletion manager The on-card component that embodies the mechanisms necessary to delete an applet or library and its associated data on smart cards using Java Card technology.Atomic Activation The Loader guarantees at activation time that the loaded Additional Code is activated and that the Identification Data of the TOE is updated. This functionality is called Atomic Activation. If the Atomic Activation is successful, then the resulting product is the Final TOE, otherwise (in case of interruption or incident which prevents the forming of the Final TOE), the Initial TOE shall remain in its initial state or fail secure.context A context is an object-space partition associated to a package. Applets within the same Java technology- based package belong to the same context. The firewall is the boundary between contexts (see \"current context\").current context The JCRE keeps track of the current Java Card System context (also called \"the active context\"). When a virtual method is invoked on an object, and a context switch is required and permitted, the current context is changed to correspond to the context of the applet that owns the object. When that method returns, the previous context is restored. Invocations of static methods have no effect on the current context. The current context and sharing status of an object together determine if access to an object is permissible.currently selected applet The applet has been selected for execution in the current session. The Java Card RE keeps track of the currently selected Java Card applet. Upon receiving a SELECT command from the CAD or PCD with this applet’s AID, the Java Card RE makes this applet the currently selected applet over the I/O interface that received the command. The Java Card RE sends all further APDU commands received over each interface to the currently selected applet on this interface (": "[34]",

Data stored on the RAM and subject to such failure is intended to have a limited lifetime anyway (runtime data on the stack, transient objects’ contents).

A class may be declared as being the implementation of an interface, and in this case must contain an implementation for each of the methods declared by the interface (See also shareable interface).Java Card RE The runtime environment under which Java programs in a smart card are executed. It is in charge of all the management features such as applet lifetime, applet isolation, object sharing, applet loading, applet initializing, transient objects, the transaction mechanism and so on.Java Card RE Entry Point An object owned by the Java Card RE context but accessible by any application. These methods are the gateways through which applets request privileged Java Card RE services: the instance methods associated to those objects may be invoked from any context, and when that occurs, a context switch to the Java Card RE context is performed. There are two categories of Java Card RE Entry Point Objects: Temporary ones and Permanent ones. As part of the firewall functionality, the Java Card RE detects and restricts attempts to store references to these objects.Java Card RMI Java Card Remote Method Invocation is the Java Card System version 2.2 and 3 Classic Edition mechanism enabling a client application running on the CAD platform to invoke a method on a remote object Evaluation Version ©NXP B.V. 2018.

The Java Card VM is the component that enforces separation between applications (firewall) and enables secure data sharing.Load Phase The Load Phase is starting at the beginning of the Additional Code loading and ending at the end of Atomic Activation. During the Load Phase, the Initial TOE shall be in a secure state..Loader The Loader is the software developed by the Product Manufacturer. It is used to load and activate the Additional Code into the Product FLASH or EEPROM memory. The Loader is included in the embedded software and is considered as part of the Initial TOE. see also UpdaterOS.logical channel A logical link to an application on the card. A new feature of the Java Card System, version 2.2 and 3 Classic Edition, that enables the opening of simultaneous sessions with the card, one per logical channel. Commands issued to a specific logical channel are forwarded to the active applet on that logical channel. Java Card platform, version 2.2.2 and 3 Classic Edition, enables opening up to twenty logical channels over each I/O interface (contacted or contactless).MC FW Microcontroller Firmware.

A package defines either a user library, or one or more applet definitions. A package is divided in two sets of files: export files (which exclusively contain the public interface information for an entire package of classes, for external linking purposes; export files are not used directly in a Java Card virtual machine) and CAP files.Secure Box The Secure Box is a construct which allows to run non certified third party native code and ensures that this code cannot harm, influence or manipulate the JCOP operating system or any of the applets executed by the operating system.Secure Box Native Library The Secure Box Native Library is non certified third party native code running in the Secure Box.shareable interface An interface declaring a collection of methods that an applet accepts to share with other applets. These interface methods can be invoked from an applet in a context different from the context of the object implementing the methods, thus “traversing” the firewall.subject An active entity within the TOE that causes information to flow among objects or change the system’s status. It usually acts on the behalf of a user. Objects can be active and thus are also subjects of the TOE.transient object An object whose contents are not preserved across CAD sessions. The contents of these objects are cleared at the end of the current CAD session or when a card reset is performed. Writes to the fields of a transient object are not affected by transactions.UpdaterOS OS that implements the OS Update.user Any application interpretable by the Java Card RE.

The Java Card platform uses the AID data format to identify applets and packages. AIDs are administered by the International Standards Organization (ISO), so they can be used as unique identifiers. AIDs are also used in the security policies (see ’Context’ below): applets’ AIDs are related to the selection mechanisms, packages’ AIDs are used in the enforcement of the firewall. Note: although they serve different purposes, they share the same name space.AP Application Provider.applet The name is given to a Java Card technology-based user application.

Note that execute access to native code of the Java Card System and applications is the concern of SA.NATIVE.SA.FIREWALL Firewall The Firewall shall ensure controlled sharing of class instances1 , and isolation of their data and code between packages (that is, controlled execution contexts) as well as between packages and the JCRE context. An applet shall not read, write, compare a piece of data belonging to an applet that is not in the same context, or execute one of the methods of an applet in another context without its authorization.SA.NATIVE Native Code Execution Because the execution of native code is outside of the JCS TSF scope, it must be secured so as to not provide ways to bypass the TSFs of the JCS. Loading of native code, which is as well outside those TSFs, is submitted to the same requirements. Should native software be privileged in this respect, exceptions to the policies must include a rationale for the new security framework they introduce.3.4 Bytecode Verification SA.VERIFICATION Bytecode Verification Bytecode must be verified prior to being executed. Bytecode verification includes: 1. how well-formed CAP file is and the verification of the typing constraints on the bytecode, 2. binary compatibility with installed CAP files and the assurance that the ex- port files used to check the CAP file correspond to those that will be present on the card when loading occurs.3.5 Card Management SA.CARD-MANAGEMENT Card Management 1. The card manager (CM) shall control the access to card management func- tions such as the installation, update or deletion of applets. 2. The card manager shall implement the card issuer’s policy on the card.SA.INSTALL Installation 1 This concerns in particular the arrays, which are considered as instances of the Object class in the Java programming language. Evaluation Version ©NXP B.V. 2018. All rights reserved. Evaluation documentation Rev. 1.3 – 2018-06-01 26 of 179 \f NXP Semiconductors JCOP4.0 on P73N2M0 Security Target Lite Company Public 1. The TOE must be able to return to a safe and consistent state when the installation of a package or an applet fails or be cancelled (whatever the reasons). 2. Installing an applet must have no effect on the code and data of already installed applets. The installation procedure should not be used to bypass the TSFs. In short, it is an atomic operation, free of harmful effects on the state of the other applets. 3. The procedure of loading and installing a package shall ensure its integrity and authenticity.SA.SID Subject Identification 1. Users and subjects of the TOE must be identified. 2. The identity of sensitive users and subjects associated with administrative and privileged roles must be particularly protected; this concerns the Java Card RE, the applets registered on the card, and especially the default applet and the currently selected applet (and all other active applets in Java Card System). A change of identity, especially standing for an administrative role (like an applet impersonating the Java Card RE), is a severe violation of the SFR. Selection controls the access to any data exchange between the TOE and the CAD and therefore, must be protected as well. The loading of a package or any exchange of data through the APDU buffer (which can be accessed by any applet) can lead to disclosure of keys, application code or data, and so on.SA.OBJ-DELETION Object Deletion 1. Deallocation of objects should not introduce security holes in the form of references pointing to memory zones that are not longer in use, or have been reused for other purposes. Deletion of collection of objects should not be maliciously used to circumvent the TSFs. 2. Erasure, if deemed successful, shall ensure that the deleted class instance is no longer accessible.SA.DELETION Deletion 1. Deletion of installed applets (or packages) should not introduce security holes in the form of broken references to garbage collected code or data, nor should they alter integrity or confidentiality of remaining applets. The deletion procedure should not be maliciously used to bypass the TSFs. Evaluation Version ©NXP B.V. 2018. All rights reserved. Evaluation documentation Rev. 1.3 – 2018-06-01 27 of 179 \f NXP Semiconductors JCOP4.0 on P73N2M0 Security Target Lite Company Public 2. Erasure, if deemed successful, shall ensure that any data owned by the deleted applet is no longer accessible (shared objects shall either prevent deletion or be made inaccessible). A deleted applet cannot be selected or receive APDU commands. Package deletion shall make the code of the package no longer available for execution. 3. Power failure or other failures during the process shall be taken into account in the implementation so as to preserve the SFRs. This does not mandate, however, the process to be atomic. For instance, an interrupted deletion may result in the loss of user data, as long as it does not violate the SFRs. The deletion procedure and its characteristics (whether deletion is either physi- cal or logical, what happens if the deleted application was the default applet, the order to be observed on the deletion steps) are implementation-dependent. The only commitment is that deletion shall not jeopardize the TOE (or its assets) in case of failure (such as power shortage). Deletion of a single applet instance and deletion of a whole package are func- tionally different operations and may obey different security rules. For instance, specific packages can be declared to be undeletable (for instance, the Java Card API packages), or the dependency between installed packages may forbid the deletion (like a package using super classes or super interfaces declared in an- other package).3.6 Services SA.ALARM Alarm The TOE shall provide appropriate feedback upon detection of a potential security violation. This particularly concerns the type errors detected by the bytecode verifier, the security exceptions thrown by the Java Card VM, or any other security- related event occurring during the execution of a TSF.SA.OPERATE Operate 1. The TOE must ensure continued correct operation of its security functions. 2. In case of failure during its operation, the TOE must also return to a well- defined valid state before the next service request.SA.RESOURCES Resources The TOE controls the availability of resources for the applications and enforces quotas and limitations in order to prevent unauthorized denial of service or mal- function of the TSFs. This concerns both execution (dynamic memory allocation) and installation (static memory allocation) of applications and packages. Evaluation Version ©NXP B.V. 2018. All rights reserved. Evaluation documentation Rev. 1.3 – 2018-06-01 28 of 179 \f NXP Semiconductors JCOP4.0 on P73N2M0 Security Target Lite Company PublicSA.CIPHER Cipher The TOE shall provide a means to the applications for ciphering sensitive data, for instance, through a programming interface to low-level, highly secure crypto- graphic services. In particular, those services must support cryptographic algo- rithms consistent with cryptographic usage policies and standards.SA.KEY-MNGT Key Management The TOE shall provide a means to securely manage cryptographic keys. This includes: 1. Keys shall be generated in accordance with specified cryptographic key gen- eration algorithms and specified cryptographic key sizes, 2. Keys must be distributed in accordance with specified cryptographic key dis- tribution methods, 3. Keys must be initialized before being used, 4. Keys shall be destroyed in accordance with specified cryptographic key de- struction methods.SA.PIN-MNGT PIN Management The TOE shall provide a means to securely manage PIN objects. This includes: 1. Atomic update of PIN value and try counter, 2. No rollback on the PIN-checking function, 3. Keeping the PIN value (once initialized) secret (for instance, no clear-PIN- reading function), 4. Enhanced protection of PIN’s security attributes (state, try counter ...) in confidentiality and integrity.SA.SCP Smart Card Platform The smart card platform must be secure with respect to the SFRs. Then: 1. After a power loss, RF signal loss or sudden card removal prior to completion of some communication protocol, the SCP will allow the TOE on the next power up to either complete the interrupted operation or revert to a secure state. 2. It does not allow the SFRs to be bypassed or altered and does not allow access to other low-level functions than those made available by the pack- ages of the Java Card API. That includes the protection of its private data and code (against disclosure or modification) from the Java Card System. 3. It provides secure low-level cryptographic processing to the Java Card Sys- tem. Evaluation Version ©NXP B.V. 2018. All rights reserved. Evaluation documentation Rev. 1.3 – 2018-06-01 29 of 179 \f NXP Semiconductors JCOP4.0 on P73N2M0 Security Target Lite Company Public 4. It supports the needs for any update to a single persistent object or class field to be atomic, and possibly a low-level transaction mechanism. 5. It allows the Java Card System to store data in a ”persistent technology memory” or in volatile memory, depending on its needs (for instance, tran- sient objects must not be stored in non-volatile memory). The memory model is structured and allows for low-level control accesses (segmentation fault detection). 6. It safely transmits low-level exceptions to the TOE (arithmetic exceptions, checksum errors), when applicable. 7. Finally, it is required that the IC is designed in accordance with a well-defined set of policies and standards (for instance, those specified in ": "[15]",

All assets are threatened.T.LIFE_CYCLE Life Cycle An attacker accesses to an application outside of its expected availability range thus violating irreversible life cycle phases of the application (for instance, an at- tacker repersonalizes the application). Directly threatened asset(s): D.APP_I_ DATA, D.APP_C_DATA, and D.CARD_MNGT_DATA.4.2.7 Services T.OBJ-DELETION Object Deletion The attacker keeps a reference to a garbage collected object in order to force the TOE to execute an unavailable method, to make it to crash, or to gain access to a memory containing data that is now being used by another application. See SA.OBJ-DELETION for further details. Directly threatened asset(s): D.APP_C_ DATA, D.APP_I_DATA and D.APP_KEYS.4.2.8 Miscellaneous T.PHYSICAL Physical Tampering The attacker discloses or modifies the design of the TOE, its sensitive data or application code by physical (opposed to logical) tampering means. This threat includes IC failure analysis, electrical probing, unexpected tearing, and DPA. That also includes the modification of the runtime execution of Java Card System or SCP software through alteration of the intended execution order of (set of) in- structions through physical tampering techniques. This threatens all the identified assets. This threat refers to the point (7) of the security aspect SA.SCP, and all aspects related to confidentiality and integrity of code and data.4.2.9 Random Numbers T.RND Deficiency of Random Numbers An attacker may predict or obtain information about random numbers generated by the TOE for instance because of a lack of entropy of the random numbers pro- vided. An attacker may gather information about the produced random numbers which might be a problem because they may be used for instance to generate cryptographic keys. Here the attacker is expected to take advantage of statis- tical properties of the random numbers generated by the TOE without specific knowledge about the TOE’s generator. Malfunctions or premature ageing are also considered which may assist in getting information about random numbers. Evaluation Version ©NXP B.V. 2018. All rights reserved.

The software protection of the TOE makes use of software security services which allow to detect and react on manipulation of the TOE. Two types of reactions are used: If invalid data from outside the TOE is detected then it Evaluation Version ©NXP B.V. 2018. All rights reserved. Evaluation documentation Rev. 1.3 – 2018-06-01 163 of 179 \f NXP Semiconductors JCOP4.0 on P73N2M0 Security Target Lite Company Publicis assumed that the TOE was used in a wrong way. This is indicated by an appropriate Status Word or Exception. Detected deviations from the physical operating conditions and inconsistencies of internal states and program flow however are considered to be an attack to the TOE. In such cases an internal Attack Counter is increased. Once the Attack Counter reaches the maximum value, the TOE will go into Restricted Mode. Typical software security mechanisms implemented in the TOE are e.g.: • Complex patterned values are used instead of boolean values which are sensible to tampering (only one bit needs to be changed to manipulate a false into a true). • Small random delays are inserted in the program flow to make successful physical interfering more difficult. • Secret information like Keys or PINs are stored encrypted in the TOE. The Masterkey to decrypt these is not accessible during normal operation. • Critical data is read after it has been written to non volatile memory. • Enhanced cryptographic support is based on the certified Security Software for DES, AES, ECC and RSA including protection against fault injection and random number generation. • Critical values (like PINs) are compared timing-invariant. This prevents from side channel attacks.A full list of software countermeasures is contained in ADV_ARC. Further protection against Tampering and Logical Interference is realized by the MMU implemented in hardware. The MMU is able to perform access control to all types of memory. The special function registers access can be restricted by the bridges between the CPU and the peripherals. JCOP4 defines several MMU contexts which restrict access to memory areas. The Master key is stored in specific coprocessor registers and blocked for reading/writing during JCOP operation. Additionally Interference and Logical Tampering is prevented by hardware security services. JCOP4 OS runs on a certified smart card HW platform which protects against bypass by physical and logical means such as: • cryptographic coprocessors (for symmetric and asymmetric cryptography) protected against DPA and DFA, • enhanced security sensors for clock frequency range, low and high temperature sensor, supply voltage sensors Single Fault Injection (SFI) attack detection, light sensors, and • encryption of data stored in persistent and transient memory.8.4 Protection against Bypass of Security Related Actions JCOP4 prevents bypassing security related actions by several software counter measures. Different mechanisms are used depending on the software environment. Evaluation Version ©NXP B.V. 2018. All rights reserved.
