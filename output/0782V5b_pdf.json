the end of this document 3.5 www.infineon.com 2020-07-15 Security Target Mercury ePassport v2.20 Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT) 1 Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT) 1.1 ST reference The title of this document is “Security Target Mercury ePassport v2.20,”. It´s version is 3.5 dated 2020-07-15. 1.2 TOE reference The TOE is a composite based on the M7892 D11 and P11 platforms (for details see [ST_Platforms]). Both hardware platforms have identical layouts with one minor exception not affecting the behavior of the TOE. The name of the TOE is Mercury ePassport v2.20. The TOE is a contactless chip implementing an ePassport and its version is v2.20. This ST is compatible to [ST_Platforms]. It is strictly conformant to [PP_SAC], if a BIS chooses PACE as authentication method and [PP_BAC], if a BIS chooses BAC as authentication method. In order to identify the TOE a functionality is provided to the personalization agent to extract the hash values (CBC MAC according to [ISO9797-1] MAC algorithm 1 with key value zero) over several TOE components.The TOE can be identified by the hash references as follows: Table 1 Hash values TOE component Hash value Mercury ePassport application B6C20E3BB4890658955F1C9BAD1FD71B Mercury OS D392D3A02E4ED6B20212CA06EFA04900 Mercury pre-personalized file system 85498BE1557143F9AAAAF1D49BB72F42 Hardware identification data (P11) 50FAFC994337EE7BA00D98638C689BD7 Hardware identification data (D11) DF296F4C789F98C317DBFBB0536D7F92 The Mercury OS version is 2017.03. 1.3 TOE overview 1.3.1 TOE definition The Target of Evaluation (TOE) addressed by this ST is an electronic travel document representing a contactless smart card programmed according to [ICAO_SAC]. This smart card / passport provides the following application:  the travel document containing the related user data as well as data needed for authentication (incl. PACE/BAC passwords); this application is intended to be used by governmental organisations as a machine readable travel document (MRTD). For the ePassport application, the travel document holder can control access to his user data by conscious presenting his travel document to governmental organisations.The travel document’s chip is integrated into a physical (plastic or paper), optically readable part of the travel document, which – as the final product – shall eventually supersede still existing, merely optically readable travel documents. The plastic or paper, optically readable cover of the travel document, where the travel document’s chip is embedded in, is not part of the CC Document 3 3.5 2020-07-15 Security Target Mercury ePassport v2.20 Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT) TOE. The tying-up of the travel document’s chip to the plastic travel document is achieved by physical and organizational security measures being out of scope of the TOE. 1.3.2 TOE operational usage A State or Organization issues MRTDs to be used by the holder for international travel. The traveler presents a MRTD to the inspection system to prove his or her identity. The MRTD in context of this ST contains (i) visual (eye readable) biographical data and portrait of the holder, (ii) a separate data summary (MRZ data) for visual and machine reading using OCR methods (see [ICAO_9303_01]) in the Machine readable zone (MRZ) and (iii) data elements on the MRTD’s chip according to LDS for contactless machine reading. The authentication of the traveler is based on the possession of a valid MRTD personalized for a holder with the claimed identity as given on the biographical data page. The issuing State or Organization is supposed to verify the authenticity of the data of genuine MRTD’s. The receiving State is supposed to trust a genuine MRTD of an issuing State or Organization. 1.3.3 TOE major security features The following TOE security features are the most significant for its operational use:  Only terminals possessing authorisation information (the shared secret MRZ optically retrieved by the terminal) can get access to the user data stored on the TOE and use security functionality of the travel document under control of the travel document holder,  Verifying authenticity and integrity as well as securing confidentiality of user data in the communication channel between the TOE and the terminal connected  Averting of inconspicuous tracing of the travel document,  Self-protection of the TOE security functionality and the data stored inside. The authentication mechansisms in operation mode contributing to a Security Function are PACE and BAC. Any product using BAC will be conformant to [PP_BAC] but not to [PP_SAC]. Conversely any product using PACE will be conformant to [PP_SAC] but not to [PP_BAC]; i.e. the TOE supports BAC, but, while performing BAC, it is acting outside of security policy defined by the [PP_SAC]. Therefore, organizations being responsible for the operation of inspection systems shall be aware of this context. 1.4 TOE Description 1.4.1 Component overview Figure 1 provides an overview of the TOE’s components: CC Document 4 3.5 2020-07-15 Security Target Mercury ePassport v2.20 Security Target Introduction (ASE_INT) Lifecycle Mercury ePassport Application management Mercury Pre- personalized file BAC PACE system TOE user Mercury OS guidance FW and assymmetric cryptographic libraries (BSI-DSZ-CC-0891-v4-2019 and BSI-DSZ-CC-1105-2020) M7892 D11 Hardware (BSI-DSZ-CC-0891-v4-2019) and M7892 P11 Hardware (BSI-DSZ-CC-1105-2020) Figure 1 TOE components overview The TOE is a contactless chip of an ePassport including the Mercury ePass application.
