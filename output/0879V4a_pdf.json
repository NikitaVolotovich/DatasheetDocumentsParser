Certification 1. Preliminary Remarks Under the BSIG1 Act, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has the task of issuing certificates for information technology products. Certification of a product is carried out on the instigation of the vendor or a distributor, hereinafter called the sponsor. A part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product according to the security criteria published by the BSI or generally recognised security criteria. The evaluation is normally carried out by an evaluation facility recognised by the BSI or by BSI itself. The result of the certification procedure is the present Certification Report. This report contains among others the certificate (summarised assessment) and the detailed Certification Results. The Certification Results contain the technical description of the security functionality of the certified product, the details of the evaluation (strength and weaknesses) and instructions for the user. 2. Specifications of the Certification Procedure The certification body conducts the procedure according to the criteria laid down in the following: ● Act on the Federal Office for Information Security 1 ● BSI Certification and Approval Ordinance2 ● BSI Schedule of Costs 3 ● Special decrees issued by the Bundesministerium des Innern (Federal Ministry of the Interior) ● DIN EN ISO/IEC 17065 standard ● BSI certification: Scheme documentation describing the certification process (CC- Produkte) [3] ● BSI certification: Scheme documentation on requirements for the Evaluation Facility, its approval and licencing process (CC-Stellen) [3] ● Common Criteria for IT Security Evaluation (CC), Version 3.1 4 [1] also published as ISO/IEC 15408. 1 Act on the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI-Gesetz - BSIG) of 14 August 2009, Bundesgesetzblatt I p. 2821 2 Ordinance on the Procedure for Issuance of Security Certificates and approval by the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI-Zertifizierungs- und -Anerkennungsverordnung - BSIZertV) of 17 December 2014, Bundesgesetzblatt 2014, part I, no. 61, p. 2231 3 Schedule of Cost for Official Procedures of the Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI-Kostenverordnung, BSI-KostV) of 3 March 2005, Bundesgesetzblatt I, p. 519 6 / 33 BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V4-2020 Certification Report ● Common Methodology for IT Security Evaluation (CEM), Version 3.1 [2] also published as ISO/IEC 18045 ● BSI certification: Application Notes and Interpretation of the Scheme (AIS) [4] 3. Recognition Agreements In order to avoid multiple certification of the same product in different countries a mutual recognition of IT security certificates - as far as such certificates are based on ITSEC or CC - under certain conditions was agreed. 3.1. European Recognition of CC – Certificates (SOGIS-MRA) The SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) Version 3 became effective in April 2010. It defines the recognition of certificates for IT-Products at a basic recognition level and, in addition, at higher recognition levels for IT-Products related to certain SOGIS Technical Domains only. The basic recognition level includes Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation Assurance Levels EAL 1 to EAL 4. For \"Smartcards and similar devices\" a SOGIS Technical Domain is in place. For \"HW Devices with Security Boxes\" a SOGIS Technical Domains is in place, too. In addition, certificates issued for Protection Profiles based on Common Criteria are part of the recognition agreement. The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes, details on recognition, and the history of the agreement can be seen on the website at https://www.sogis.eu. The SOGIS-MRA logo printed on the certificate indicates that it is recognised under the terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition. This certificate is recognized under SOGIS-MRA for all assurance components selected. 3.2. International Recognition of CC – Certificates (CCRA) The international arrangement on the mutual recognition of certificates based on the CC (Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, CCRA-2014) has been ratified on 08 September 2014. It covers CC certificates based on collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP) (exact use), CC certificates based on assurance components up to and including EAL 2 or the assurance family Flaw Remediation (ALC_FLR) and CC certificates for Protection Profiles and for collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP). The current list of signatory nations and approved certification schemes can be seen on the website: https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org. The Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement logo printed on the certificate indicates that this certification is recognised under the terms of this agreement by the related bodies of the signatory nations. A disclaimer beneath the logo indicates the specific scope of recognition. This certificate is recognized according to the rules of CCRA-2014, i. e. up to and including CC part 3 EAL 2+ ALC_FLR components. 4 Proclamation of the Bundesministerium des Innern of 12 February 2007 in the Bundesanzeiger dated 23 February 2007, p. 3730 7 / 33 Certification Report BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V4-2020 4. Performance of Evaluation and Certification The certification body monitors each individual evaluation to ensure a uniform procedure, a uniform interpretation of the criteria and uniform ratings. The product Infineon Security Controller M7893 B11 with optional RSA2048/4096 v2.03.008, EC v2.03.008, SHA-2 v1.01, SCL v2.02.010 libraries and Toolbox v2.03.008 and with specific IC dedicated software (firmware), has undergone the certification procedure at BSI. This is a re-certification based on BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V3-2018. Specific results from the evaluation process BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V3-2018 were re-used. The evaluation of the product Infineon Security Controller M7893 B11 with optional RSA2048/4096 v2.03.008, EC v2.03.008, SHA-2 v1.01, SCL v2.02.010 libraries and Toolbox v2.03.008 and with specific IC dedicated software (firmware), was conducted by TÜV Informationstechnik GmbH. The evaluation was completed on 11 February 2020. TÜV Informationstechnik GmbH is an evaluation facility (ITSEF) 5 recognised by the certification body of BSI. For this certification procedure the sponsor and applicant is: Infineon Technologies AG. The product was developed by: Infineon Technologies AG. The certification is concluded with the comparability check and the production of this Certification Report. This work was completed by the BSI. 5. Validity of the Certification Result This Certification Report applies only to the version of the product as indicated. The confirmed assurance package is valid on the condition that ● all stipulations regarding generation, configuration and operation, as given in the following report, are observed, ● the product is operated in the environment described, as specified in the following report and in the Security Target. For the meaning of the assurance components and assurance levels please refer to CC itself. Detailed references are listed in part C of this report. The Certificate issued confirms the assurance of the product claimed in the Security Target at the date of certification. As attack methods evolve over time, the resistance of the certified version of the product against new attack methods needs to be re-assessed. Therefore, the sponsor should apply for the certified product being monitored within the assurance continuity program of the BSI Certification Scheme (e.g. by a re-assessment or re-certification). Specifically, if results of the certification are used in subsequent evaluation and certification procedures, in a system integration process or if a user\u0027s risk management needs regularly updated results, it is recommended to perform a re- assessment on a regular e.g. annual basis. In order to avoid an indefinite usage of the certificate when evolved attack methods would require a re-assessment of the products resistance to state of the art attack methods, the maximum validity of the certificate has been limited. The certificate issued on 12 February 2020 is valid until 11 February 2025. Validity can be re-newed by re-certification. The owner of the certificate is obliged: 5 Information Technology Security Evaluation Facility 8 / 33 BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V4-2020 Certification Report 1. when advertising the certificate or the fact of the product\u0027s certification, to refer to the Certification Report as well as to provide the Certification Report, the Security Target and user guidance documentation mentioned herein to any customer of the product for the application and usage of the certified product, 2. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately about vulnerabilities of the product that have been identified by the developer or any third party after issuance of the certificate, 3. to inform the Certification Body at BSI immediately in the case that security relevant changes in the evaluated life cycle, e.g. related to development and production sites or processes, occur, or the confidentiality of documentation and information related to the Target of Evaluation (TOE) or resulting from the evaluation and certification procedure where the certification of the product has assumed this confidentiality being maintained, is not given any longer. In particular, prior to the dissemination of confidential documentation and information related to the TOE or resulting from the evaluation and certification procedure that do not belong to the deliverables according to the Certification Report part B, or for those where no dissemination rules have been agreed on, to third parties, the Certification Body at BSI has to be informed. In case of changes to the certified version of the product, the validity can be extended to the new versions and releases, provided the sponsor applies for assurance continuity (i.e. re-certification or maintenance) of the modified product, in accordance with the procedural requirements, and the evaluation does not reveal any security deficiencies. 6.

Certification Results The following results represent a summary of ● the Security Target of the sponsor for the Target of Evaluation, ● the relevant evaluation results from the evaluation facility, and ● complementary notes and stipulations of the certification body. 10 / 33 BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V4-2020 Certification Report 1. Executive Summary The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is an Infineon Security Controller M7893 B11 with optional Software Library RSA2048/4096 v2.03.008, EC v2.03.008, SHA-2 v1.01, SCL v2.02.010 libraries, and Toolbox v2.03.008, as well as with specific IC dedicated software (firmware). The TOE provides a real 16-bit CPU-architecture and is compatible to the 80251 microcontroller architecture. The major components of the core system are the two CPUs (Central Processing Units), acting as one, the MMU (Memory Management Unit) and MED (Memory Encryption/Decryption Unit). The dual interface controller is able to communicate using either the contact based or the contactless interface. The TOE consists of the hardware part, the firmware parts and the software parts. The software parts are differentiated into the cryptographic libraries RSA, EC, and SHA-2, symmetric cryptographic libraries and the supporting libraries Toolbox and Base. The Base Library does not provide any specific security functionality on its own. However it is a necessary perquisite in order to use the RSA, EC and Toolbox libraries. This TOE is intended to be used in smart cards and other form factors for particularly security-relevant applications and for its prevalent use as developing platform for smart card operating systems. The term Smartcard Embedded Software is used in the following for all operating systems and applications stored and executed on the TOE. The TOE is the platform for the Smartcard Embedded Software. The Security Target [6] is the basis for this certification. It is based on the certified Protection Profile Security IC Platform Protection Profile, Version 1.0, 15 June 2007, BSI- CC-PP-0035-2007 [8]. The TOE Security Functional Requirements are implemented by the following TOE Security Functionality: TOE Security Functionality Addressed issue SF_DPM Device Phase Management: The life cycle of the TOE is split up into several phases. Different operation modes help to protect the TOE during each phase of its lifecycle. SF_PS Protection against Snooping: The TOE uses various means to protect from snooping of memories and busses and prevents single stepping. SF_PMA Protection against Modifying Attacks: This TOE implements protection against modifying attacks of memories, alarm lines and sensors. SF_PLA Protection against Logical Attacks: The memory access control of the TOE uses a memory management unit (MMU) to control the access to the available physical memory by using virtual memory addresses and to segregate the code and data to a privilege level model. The MMU controls the address permissions of up seven privileged levels and gives the software the possibility to define different access rights. The address permissions of the privilege levels are 11 / 33 Certification Report BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V4-2020 TOE Security Functionality Addressed issue controlled by the MMU. In case of an access violation the MMU will trigger a reset and then a trap service routine can react on the access violation. SF_CS Cryptographic Support: The TOE is equipped with several hardware accelerators and software modules to support the standard symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic operations. The components are a coprocessor supporting the DES and AES algorithms and a combination of a coprocessor and software modules to support RSA cryptography, RSA key generation, ECDSA signature generation and verification, ECDH key agreement and EC public key calculation and public key testing. Furthermore, the TOE is equipped with an optional SHA-2 library and HASH module as well as well as an AIS31 conformant TRNG that meets the functionality class PTG.2. In addition the optional Symmetric library (SCL) provides a high-level interface to 3DES and AES symmetric cryptographic operation implemented on the symmetric hardware coprocessor. Table 1: TOE Security Functionalities For more details please refer to the Security Target [6] and [9], chapter 8. The assets to be protected by the TOE are defined in the Security Target [6] and [9], chapter 4.1.2. Based on these assets the TOE Security Problem is defined in terms of Assumptions, Threats and Organisational Security Policies. This is outlined in the Security Target [6] and [9], chapter 4. This certification covers the configurations of the TOE as outlined in chapter 8. The vulnerability assessment results as stated within this certificate do not include a rating for those cryptographic algorithms and their implementation suitable for encryption and decryption (see BSIG Section 9, Para. 4, Clause 2). The certification results only apply to the version of the product indicated in the certificate and on the condition that all the stipulations are kept as detailed in this Certification Report. This certificate is not an endorsement of the IT product by the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) or any other organisation that recognises or gives effect to this certificate, and no warranty of the IT product by BSI or any other organisation that recognises or gives effect to this certificate, is either expressed or implied. 2. Identification of the TOE The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is called: Infineon Security Controller M7893 B11 with optional RSA2048/4096 v2.03.008, EC v2.03.008, SHA-2 v1.01, SCL v2.02.010 libraries and Toolbox v2.03.008 and with specific IC dedicated software (firmware), The following table outlines the TOE deliverables: 12 / 33 BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V4-2020 Certification Report No Type Identifier Release Form of Delivery 1 HW M7893 Smart Card IC B11 (produced in Complete modules, with or Dresden) without inlay mounting, with or without inlay antenna mounting, in form of plain wafers, in an IC case or in bare dies 2 SW RSA library (optional) RSA2048 Object code in electronic form v2.03.008 RSA4096 v2.03.008 3 SW EC library (optional) EC v2.03.008 Object code in electronic form 4 SW SHA-2 library (optional) SHA-2 v1.01 Object code in electronic form 5 SW Toolbox library (optional) Toolbox Object code in electronic form v2.03.008 6 SW SCL library (optional) v2.02.010 Object code in electronic form 7 FW STS Self Test Software (the FW-identifier Stored in test ROM on the IC IC Dedicated Test Software) 78.019.03.4 (patch in SOLID FLASH) 8 FW RMS Resource FW-identifier Stored in reserved area of user Management System (the IC 78.019.03.4 ROM on the IC (patch in SOLID Dedicated Support FLASH) Software) 9 FW Service Algorithm (SA) FW-identifier Stored in reserved area of user 78.019.03.4 ROM on the IC (patch in SOLID FLASH) 10 FW Flash Loader FW-identifier Stored in reserved area of user 78.019.03.4 ROM and parts of it in SOLID FLASH on the IC (patch in SOLID FLASH) 11 SW ROM code (including -- Stored in User ROM on the IC.

Furthermore, the delivery documentation describes in a sufficient manner how the various procedures and technical measures provide for the detection of modifications and any discrepancies between the TOE respective parts of it send by the TOE Manufacturer and the version received by the Composite Product Manufacturer. Three different delivery procedures have to be taken into consideration: ● Delivery of the IC dedicated software components (IC dedicated SW, guidance) from the TOE Manufacturer to the IC Embedded Software Developer. ● Delivery of the IC Embedded Software (ROM / Flash data, initialisation and pre- personalisation data) from the IC Embedded Software Developer to the TOE Manufacturer. ● Delivery of the final TOE from the TOE Manufacturer to the Composite Product Manufacturer. After phase 3 the TOE is delivered in form of wafers or sawn wafers, after phase 4 in form of modules (with or without inlay antenna). Respective distribution centers are listed in Appendix B (see below). The individual TOE hardware is uniquely identified by its identification data. The identification data contains the lot number, the wafer number and the coordinates of the chip on the wafer. Each individual TOE can therefore be traced unambiguously and thus assigned to the entire development and production process. The hardware part of the TOE is identified by M7893 B11. Another characteristic of the TOE are the chip identification data. These chip identification data is accessible via the Generic Chip Identification Mode (GCIM) see [16] chapter 7.10.3. The firmware part of the TOE is also identified also via the GCIM for all of the firmware parts. 14 / 33 BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V4-2020 Certification Report The SCL (optional), RSA (optional), EC (optional), SHA-2 (optional), Toolbox (optional), and Base library (optional), as separate software parts of the TOE, are also identified by their unique version numbers. The user can identify these versions by calculating the hash signatures of the provided library files. The mapping of these hash signatures to the version numbers is provided in the Security Target [6] and [9] section 10. For further, detailed information regarding TOE identification see [9], section 1.2. Please also note, that as the TOE is under control of the user software, the TOE Manufacturer can only guarantee the integrity up to the delivery procedure. It is in the responsibility of the Composite Product Manufacturer to include mechanisms in the implemented software (developed by the IC Embedded Software Developer) which allows detection of modifications after the delivery. 3. Security Policy The Security Policy is expressed by the set of Security Functional Requirements and implemented by the TOE. It covers the following issues: Symmetric cryptographic block cipher algorithms (Triple-DES and AES), to ensure the confidentiality of plain text data by encryption and to support secure authentication protocols and it will provide a random number generation of appropriate quality. The RSA library is used to provide a high level interface to RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) cryptography implemented on the hardware component Crypto2304T and includes countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The EC library is used to provide a high level interface to Elliptic Curve cryptography implemented on the hardware component Crypto2304T and includes countermeasures against SPA, DPA and DFA attacks. The SHA-library provides the calculation of a hash value of freely chosen data input in the CPU. As the TOE is a hardware security platform, the security policy of the TOE is also to provide protection against leakage of information (e.g. to ensure the confidentiality of cryptographic keys during AES, Triple-DES, RSA and EC cryptographic functions performed by the TOE), against physical probing, against malfunctions, against physical manipulations and against abuse of functionality. Hence the TOE shall ● maintain the integrity and the confidentiality of data stored in the memory of the TOE and ● maintain the integrity, the correct operation and the confidentiality of security functionalities (security mechanisms and associated functions) provided by the TOE. 4. Assumptions and Clarification of Scope The Assumptions defined in the Security Target and some aspects of Threats and Organisational Security Policies are not covered by the TOE itself. These aspects lead to specific security objectives to be fulfilled by the TOE-Environment. The following topics are of relevance: OE.Plat-Appl (Usage of Hardware Platform), OE.Resp-Appl (Treatment of User Data) and OE.Process-Sec-IC (Protection during Composite product manufacturing). Details can be found in the Security Target [6] and [9], chapter 5.2. 15 / 33 Certification Report BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V4-2020 5. Architectural Information The TOE is an integrated circuit (IC) providing a platform for an operating sytem and application software used in smartcards but also in any other device or form factor requiring a high level of resistance against attackers. A top level block diagram and a list of subsystems can be found within the TOE description of the Security Target [6], chapter 2.1. The TOE consists of a core system, memories, computing peripherals, system peripherals, standard peripherals, an analogue module and the connecting busses. The major components of the core system are the double CPU (Central Processing Units) including the internal encryption leaving no plain data, the MMU (Memory Management Unit) and MED (Memory Encryption/Decryption Unit). The Block diagram provides a simplified overview upon the hardware subsystems in the Security Target [6] and [9], figure 1. The symmetric co-processor (SCP) combines both AES and Triple-DES with dual-key or triple-key hardware acceleration. The Asymmetric Crypto Co-processor is called Crypto2304T and provides hardware support for asymmetric algorithms like RSA and EC. The software part of the TOE consists of the cryptographic RSA-, EC-, SCL- and the SHA- 2 libraries and the supporting Toolbox and Base libraries. If RSA or EC or Toolbox or combinations hereof are part of the shipment, automatically the Base Library of the same version is included. 6. Documentation The evaluated documentation as outlined in table 2 is being provided with the product to the customer. This documentation contains the required information for secure usage of the TOE in accordance with the Security Target. Additional obligations and notes for secure usage of the TOE as outlined in chapter 10 of this report have to be followed. 7. IT Product Testing The developer performed five categories of tests: ● Simulation Tests (design verification): The simulation tests are carried out in the course of the development of the TOE during the IC design phase. They verify that the designed circuits satisfy the specifications. ● Qualification Tests: For each mask version a qualification test is performed. Via the results of these tests a qualification report is generated. The positive result of the qualification is one part of the necessary testing results documented with the qualification report. The qualification report is completed after the verification testing (see below) and the security evaluation (see below) are performed successfully. The tests performed and their results are listed in the qualification report. The results of the tests are the basis on which it is decided, whether the TOE is released to production. ● Verification Tests: With these tests in user mode the functionality of the end user environment is checked. ● Security Evaluation Tests: In the context of security evaluation testing the security mechanisms is tested again in the user mode only focusing on security. Here is not 16 / 33 BSI-DSZ-CC-0879-V4-2020 Certification Report only verified that the security functionality is working as this was already tested on every single TOE during production, but also it is tested how well the security functionality is working and the effectiveness is calculated. This step is necessary as the mechanisms work together and that must be evaluated in the user mode. ● Production Tests: Before delivery on every chip production tests are performed. These tests use the CRC checksums attained by the simulation tests. The aim of these tests is to check whether each chip is functioning correctly. The developer tests cover all security functionalities and all security mechanisms as identified in the functional specification. The evaluators were able to repeat the tests of the developer either using the library of programs, tools and prepared chip samples delivered to the evaluator or at the developers site. They performed independent tests to supplement, augment and to verify the tests performed by the developer. The tests of the developer were repeated by sampling, by repetition of complete regression tests and by software routines developed by the evaluators and computed on samples with an evaluation operating system. For the developer tests repeated by the evaluators other test parameters were used and the test equipment was varied. Security features of the TOE realised by specific design and layout measures were checked by the evaluators during layout inspections both in design data and on the final product. The evaluation has shown that the actual version of the TOE provides the security functionalities as specified by the developer. The test results confirm the correct implementation of the TOE security functionalities. For penetration testing the evaluators took all security functionalities into consideration. Intensive penetration testing was planned based on the analysis results and performed for the underlying mechanisms of security functionalities using bespoke equipment and expert know how. The penetration tests considered both the physical tampering of the TOE and attacks which do not modify the TOE physically. The penetration tests results confirm that the TOE is resistant to attackers with high attack potential in the intended environment for the TOE. 8. Evaluated Configuration This certification covers the following configurations of the TOE: ● Smartcard IC M7893 B11. Depending on the blocking configuration, a M7893 product can have a different user available configuration as described in",
